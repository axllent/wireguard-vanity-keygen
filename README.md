# WireGuard vanity keygen

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/axllent/wireguard-vanity-keygen)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/axllent/wireguard-vanity-keygen)

A command-line vanity (public) key generator for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). It only matches the prefix of generated public keys, and not whether the search matches anywhere in the public key. The concept is based on [wireguard-vanity-address](https://github.com/warner/wireguard-vanity-address), however I wanted something a little more streamlined.


## Features

- Generates compliant [curve25519](https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html) private and public keys
- Configurable multi-core processing (defaults to all cores)
- Optional case sensitive searching
- Search multiple prefixes at once
- Exit after results limit reached (defaults to 1)
- Displays probability and estimated runtime based on quick benchmark


## Usage options

```
Usage: wireguard-vanity-keygen [OPTIONS] <SEARCH> [<SEARCH>...]

Options:
  -c, --case-sensitive   case sensitive match (default false)
  -t, --threads int      threads (defaults to all available cores minus 1)
  -l, --limit int        limit results to n (exists after) (default 1)
```


## Example

```
$ wireguard-vanity-keygen -l 4 test pc1/ 
Calculating speed: 49,950 calculations per second using 4 CPU cores
Case-insensitive search, exiting after 4 results
Probability for "test": 1 in 2,085,136 (approx 41 seconds per match)
Probability for "pc1/": 1 in 5,914,624 (approx 1 minute per match)

or build from source `go install github.com/axllent/wireguard-vanity-keygen`.


## FAQ

### What characters can I search for?

Valid characters include `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `/` and `+`. There are no other characters in a hash.


### Why does `test` & `tes1` show different probabilities despite having 4 characters each?

With case-insensitive searches (default), a-z have the chance of matching both uppercase and lowercase. A search for "cat" can match `Cat`, `cAT` etc.


### How accurate are the estimated times?

They are not (and cannot be) accurate. Keys are completely randomly generated, and the estimate is based on a law of averages. For instance, you could find a match for a one in a billion chance on the very first hit, or it could take you 5 billion attempts. It will however give you an indication based on your CPU speed, word count, case sensitivity, and use of numbers or characters.


### Why do I need this?

You don't. I wrote it because I run a WireGuard server, which does not provide any reference as to who the key belongs to (`wg` on the server). Using vanity keys, I can at least identify connections. I also wanted to learn more about multi-core processing in Golang.
